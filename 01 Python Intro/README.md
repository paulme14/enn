# Learning Goals

By the end of this Python introduction, we will have covered the following:

* **Setup a Python software development environment** using JupyterHub or Miniconda
* **Write Python code** knowing the basic syntax
* **Use Jupyter notebooks** for interactive coding sessions
* **Perform data processing** using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* **Perform data visualization** using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Task Description

For this week you are tasked to solve the Jupyter Notebook called homework. That notebook contains various exercises related to the field of machine learning and data science. With those skills in your pocket, you are well prepared to solve further homeworks and the assignments.

Good Luck and much Fun!!
